# Thirty
## A Yahtzee-ish dice game for Android
### Description
Thirty is a single-player dice game very similar to Yahtzee. However, instead of trying to accumulate as many faces of one kind, or special categories like Full House, the goal is trying to accumulate combinations that adds up to a number between 4 and 12. For instance, if a round's final set of dice has values 4, 3, 6, 5, 2, 1 and 5, the player can choose "10" as 4 + 6 as well as 5 as 5 adds up to 10. A dice may only be accounted for once and in this example, the score will be 10 * 2 = 20. Finally, there's also the combination Low, which allows accounting for all dice < 4. There are 10 possible combinations and rounds and the max allowed rolls per round is 3, which equals max 30 rolls in total, hence the name. Download and play now!
